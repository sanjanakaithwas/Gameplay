# Gameplay
A notorious criminal escape artist has vanished again. However, the criminal may be hiding in only one of the possible 5 neighbouring cities. 3 fearless cops have volunteered in capturing the fugitive hiding and they need your help!
These functionalities have been implemented-
1. Selection of city for each cop
2. Selection of vehicle options for each cop.
3. Result page indicating the capture status and, if successful, the capturing cop's name.
Data is coming from backend so I've used Nodejs for the same and then connected it to the frontend by making API calls.
